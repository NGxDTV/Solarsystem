# Solar System Simulation

This project is an interactive 3D solar system simulation built using Three.js. It allows users to explore planets, control camera views, toggle various effects, and even manipulate the simulation speed.

## Features
- **Realistic Solar System**: Includes the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
- **Planetary Orbits**: Planets orbit the Sun based on their relative speeds.
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, pause, reset, and manipulate simulation settings with buttons and sliders.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Toggle fog, starfield, orbit paths, and planet trails.
- **Music & Sound Effects**: Ambient sounds and background music.
- **Minimap & Debugging**: Includes a small overview minimap and debugging panel.
- **Screenshot Feature**: Capture high-quality images of your simulation.

## Usage
### Controls
- **Buttons**: Toggle different features like camera reset, full-screen mode, and randomization.
- **Sliders**: Adjust simulation speed, planet sizes, and field of view.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `C`: Random background color
  - `B`: Bullet time (slow motion)
  - `Y`: Toggle wireframe mode
  - `I`: Show/hide info panel
  - `M`: Toggle background music
  - `K`: Auto-rotate camera
  - `L`: Toggle environment mapping
  - `G`: Toggle grid view

### Navigation
- **Double-click** on an object to fly to it.
- **Left-click & hold** to rotate the camera.
- **Mouse wheel** to zoom in and out.
- **Right-click & hold** to freely move the camera.
- **Select objects** to display orbit lines and additional information.
